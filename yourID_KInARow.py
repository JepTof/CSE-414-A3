        # 1. Generate candidate moves: iterate over rows and columns of
        #    current_state.board; any square equal to ' ' is a legal move.
        # 2. For each candidate position (i, j), build a successor state:
        #      new_s = State(old=current_state)       # deep copy
        #      new_s.board[i][j] = current_state.whose_move
        #      new_s.change_turn()                    # switch X <-> O
        # 3. Count blank squares before searching to detect a full board (draw)
        #    and to limit recursion depth appropriately.
        # 4. Call self.minimax(...) on the current state to get the best move.
        # 5. Compose an utterance string appropriate to your agent's persona.
        # 6. Return format:
        #      DEMO / COMPETITION: [[move, new_state], utterance]
        #      AUTOGRADER:         [[move, new_state, stats], utterance]
        #    where stats is a dict with keys defined in agent_base.py, e.g.:
        #      stats['alpha_beta_cutoffs_this_turn']        = self.alpha_beta_cutoffs_this_turn

        #     If pruning is True: check alpha/beta cutoff and break early.
        #     Update alpha (if is_max) or beta (if not is_max) after each child.
